PROGRAMS THE COLORS ARE INJECTED EITHER DIRECTLY FROM MATUGEN OR BY NIX USING
THE GENERATED MATUGEN THEME.JSON

[THIS](USERS/REXIES.NIX) IS THE ENTRY POINT FOR PLANTING MY DOTFILES IN PLACE.

## WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
INITIALLY I HAD DITCHED HOME-MANAGER FOR WRAPPING PROGRAMS MYSELF
THIS WORKED QUITE WELL IN MY FAVOUR EXCEPT FOR THE FOLLOWING GRIEVANCES:
- NUSHELL WAS BUGGING THE HECK OUT INCONSISTENTLY FOR REMOTE SESSIONS (SSH)
- I HAD TO LOG OUT AND BACK TO HAVE HYPRLAND RELOAD ITS CONFIG
- AND THE LAST AND FINALLY STRAW THAT PUSHED ME TO [HJEM](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/FEEL-CO/HJEM) WAS [MATUGEN](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/INIOX/MATUGEN)

IT WAS A PAIN TO INTEGRATE MATUGEN SEAMLESSLY INTO THIS, SO I DECIDED TO JUST
SWITCH OVER THE PARTS OF MY CONFIG THAT REQUIRED MATUGEN TO USE HJEM. I MAY OR
MAY NOT SOON TRANSLATE ALL THE WRAPPERS THAT I AM USING CURRENTLY INTO PLAIN OL
HJEM CONFIGS BUT THAT'S FOR LATER. 

AT ITS CURRENT THE HJEM + MATUGEN CONFIGURATION IS ONLY ABLE TO WORK WITH A
SINGLE WALLPAPER THEREFORE IT IS LOCKED TO A SINGLE USER CONFIGURATION. I AM
SURE I CAN EXTEND IT TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE USERS BUT AS OF NOW I DON'T YET HAVE
THE NEED TO DO SO.

YOU CAN LOOK INTO `USERS/WRAPPERS` FOR THE CONFIG OF EACH OF THE PROGRAMS I
HAVE TINKERED WITH MOST NOTABLY **MPV** FEATURING SUPPORT FOR ANIME4K SHADERS
AND A CUSTOM **NEOVIM** CONFIGURATION WITH
[LZ.N](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/NVIM-NEOROCKS/LZ.N) LAZY LOADING.

AND AS OF 15TH MARCH 2025, NEWER CONFIGS WILL LIVE IN `USERS/CONFIGS` WITH THEIR
SUPPORTING MATUGEN TEMPLATES IN `NIXOSMODULES/EXTERNAL/MATUGEN/TEMPLATES`

## NVIM CONFIGURATION
I HAVE ALSO EXPOSED NEOVIM IN THE FLAKE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF RUNNING IT WITH
```BASH
NIX RUN GITHUB:REXCRAZY804/ZAPHKIEL
```

> NOTE: NIX RUNNING `#NVIM-NO-LSP` YIELDS THE CONFIG WITHOUT DOWNLOADING ANY
LSPS (AND SOME OTHER EXTRA PACKAGES)
THE DEFAULT IS `#NVIM-WRAPPED`

## CREDITS & THANKS
FIRSTLY I HAVE TO THANK [SIOODMY](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/SIOODMY) FOR BEING THE
INSPIRATION TO DITCH HOME MANAGER AND WRITING WRAPPERS MYSELF I HAD KNOWN OF
WRAPPERS BEFORE BUT IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM I WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD OF
`PKGS.SYMLINKJOIN` :D

I ALSO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO [NOTASHELF](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/NOTASHELF) FOR
BEING THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS README AND FOR DEVELOPING THE HJEM NIXOS
MODULE 

I HAVE TO THANK BOTH THE ANANIMEGAMELAUNCHER AND HYPRLAND DISCORD COMMUNITIES
FOR ALL THE HELP I'VE RECEIVED AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE.

LASTLY, I HAVE TO TO THANK THE NIX COMMUNITY FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN
[HOME-MANAGER](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/NIX-COMMUNITY/HOME-MANAGER) AND
[NIXVIM](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/NIX-COMMUNITY/NIXVIM) BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN GREAT
